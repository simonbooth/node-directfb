This is the 'port' of the v8 bindings for directfb to Node.js .  
The package from which this project is derived came from directfb.org.

It is not complete!
There are many empty shells.

Added package.json and re-organized to modernize it for npm and node-gyp

Unknown at this point - my part (Simon) is MIT but the upstream contributions are unclear as the code was originally autogenerated by a tool.
